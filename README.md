# KhudMadad - Unicoders

## What is KhudMadad?
- KhudMadad is an application dedicated to dealing with aftermaths of disasters, such as floods, earthquakes etc. 
- KhudMadad enables users to submit reports detailing the situation at the disaster site. Similar reports (hailing from same radius, same disaster type etc.) are then clustered (using our simplistic approach), and if a certain threshold is met these reports are moved onto the public view, a timeline where users can interact with these verified reports and easily dispatch relief operations quickly and efficiently.

## Usage
- This is a mobile-first application! View it in `IPhone-SE view` for a better experience
